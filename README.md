# Guess_The_Number_Wiki_
This Repository is a wiki website for my game Guess The Number. 
This website started as a project in school in my Trade and the first version ready to be published was finished in January 2025.


Easy Gamemode for GTN (Guess The Number) has already been released onto the website and on itch io. Release date of GTN - Easy (publicy avaible) March 17, 2025.
At the moment GTN is not avaible to be publicly downloaded from Github.
